## Overall Assessment

The formal verification suite for `quiche` now covers **thirteen modules with
309 theorems, 0 sorry** (Lean 4.29.0, no Mathlib). Since run 39 the suite has
grown by four new targets: CUBIC congestion control (26 theorems, run 41),
RangeBuf offset arithmetic (19 theorems, run 43), the stream receive buffer
RecvBuf (32 theorems, run 44), and the stream send buffer SendBuf (43 theorems,
run 45). The most security-relevant new result is `emitN_le_maxData` in
`SendBuf.lean` — a formal proof that the QUIC sender can never transmit bytes
beyond the peer's advertised MAX_DATA limit (RFC 9000 §4.1), which is a
direct, machine-checked statement of the fundamental flow-control safety
property. Earlier highlights include `decode_pktnum_correct` (RFC 9000 §A.3,
run 39), `wCubic_epoch_anchor` (RFC 8312bis §5.1, run 41),
`insertContiguous_inv` (RecvBuf invariant preservation, run 44), and the
long-running `adjusted_rtt_ge_min_rtt` (ack-delay timing-attack defence, RFC
9002 §5.3). The entire suite has had zero outstanding `sorry`s since run 39.
The main cross-cutting limitation remains the Nat-vs-u64 abstraction: no file
verifies overflow behaviour, so integer-boundary edge cases are not captured.
The RecvBuf general-case `write()` (out-of-order, overlapping data) is the
largest remaining unverified component of the stream layer.

## Proved Theorems

### `FVSquad/Varint.lean` — 10 theorems

| Theorem | Level | Bug-catching potential | Notes |
|---------|-------|----------------------|-------|
| `varint_round_trip` | high | **high** | Core codec correctness; a bug here breaks all QUIC framing |
| `varint_encode_length` | mid | medium | Encodes in expected number of bytes |
| `varint_len_correct` | mid | medium | Length function consistent with encoding |
| `varint_parse_len_one` | low | low | Trivial dispatch case |
| `varint_parse_len_two` | low | low | Trivial dispatch case |
| `varint_parse_len_four` | low | low | Trivial dispatch case |
| `varint_parse_len_eight` | low | low | Trivial dispatch case |
| `varint_encode_none_iff` | mid | medium | Out-of-range inputs rejected |
| `varint_decode_none_iff` | mid | medium | Too-short buffers rejected |
| `varint_encode_produces_valid` | mid | medium | All encoded values are in-range |

**Assessment**: The round-trip theorem is high-value.  The dispatch lemmas are
low-value individually but collectively guard the length-tagging logic.  **Gap**:
no theorem verifies that the 2-bit tag in the first byte is correctly set; a bug
there would corrupt the wire format without failing `round_trip`.

---

### `FVSquad/RangeSet.lean` — 16 theorems

| Theorem | Level | Bug-catching potential | Notes |
|---------|-------|----------------------|-------|
| `insert_preserves_invariant` | high | **high** | `sorted_disjoint` maintained by `range_insert` — core structural guarantee |
| `insert_covers_union` | high | **high** | Semantic completeness: inserted range is covered by result (within no-eviction bound) |
| `remove_until_removes_small` | high | **high** | No value ≤ largest survives `range_remove_until` — direct ACK dedup safety property |
| `remove_until_preserves_large` | high | **high** | Covered values above threshold are retained — liveness guarantee |
| `remove_until_preserves_invariant` | mid | **high** | `sorted_disjoint` maintained by `range_remove_until` |
| `singleton_covers_iff` | mid | medium | Membership spec for single-element sets |
| `insert_empty` | mid | medium | Single-range insertion result is structurally correct |
| `insert_empty_covers` | mid | medium | Fresh insertion with correct coverage |
| `sorted_disjoint_tail` | low | low | Structural helper: invariant preserved on tail |
| `sorted_disjoint_head_valid` | low | low | Structural helper: first element satisfies `valid_range` |
| `empty_sorted_disjoint` | low | low | Constructor postcondition |
| `singleton_sorted_disjoint` | low | low | Single-element invariant |
| `empty_covers_nothing` | low | low | Empty set membership is always false |
| `remove_until_empty` | low | low | `range_remove_until` on empty is identity |
| `singleton_not_covers_left` | low | low | Membership excludes values strictly before range start |
| `singleton_not_covers_right` | low | low | Membership excludes values at or after range end |

**Assessment**: The invariant and semantic-union theorems are high-value for a
data structure that directly affects QUIC packet deduplication (ACK tracking).
`remove_until_removes_small` is a direct safety property: if it were false, a
received packet could be falsely acknowledged again.  **Gap**: the model omits
capacity eviction — proved theorems apply only when the set is below capacity.
A future theorem bounding behaviour under eviction would close this gap.

---

### `FVSquad/Minmax.lean` — 15 theorems (plus 4 examples)

| Theorem | Level | Bug-catching potential | Notes |
|---------|-------|----------------------|-------|
| `minmax_running_min` | high | **high** | Core running-min correctness |
| `minmax_init_correct` | low | low | Constructor postcondition |
| `minmax_monotone` | mid | medium | Running min is non-increasing |
| `minmax_samples_valid` | mid | medium | Stored samples satisfy ordering |
| `minmax_update_ge_min` | mid | medium | New min ≤ all samples |
| `minmax_window_correct` | mid | medium | Window eviction logic |
| `minmax_three_sample_invariant` | high | **high** | Three-sample data structure invariant |
| + 8 further structural/helper theorems | low–mid | low–medium | |

**Assessment**: The running-min property and three-sample invariant are
important: MinMax is used for the RTT minimum filter that gates ack-delay
adjustment.  A bug could allow spurious RTT under-estimation.  **Gap**: the
Lean model replaces the sliding time-window with a simple structural model;
time-based eviction is not verified.

---

### `FVSquad/RttStats.lean` — 24 theorems

| Theorem | Level | Bug-catching potential | Notes |
|---------|-------|----------------------|-------|
| `adjusted_rtt_ge_min_rtt` | **high** | **high** | Security property: prevents ack-delay timing attack (RFC 9002 §5.3) |
| `rtt_update_smoothed_upper_bound` | high | high | EWMA contraction — smoothed RTT ≤ adjusted_rtt when updated |
| `rtt_first_update_smoothed_eq` | mid | medium | First RTT sample sets smoothed = sample exactly |
| `rtt_first_update_min_rtt_eq` | mid | medium | First sample sets min_rtt correctly |
| `adjusted_rtt_le_latest` | mid | medium | Adjustment never exceeds raw sample |
| `rtt_update_min_rtt_le_latest` | mid | medium | min_rtt ≤ latest RTT |
| `rtt_update_min_rtt_le_prev` | mid | medium | min_rtt is non-increasing |
| `rtt_update_max_rtt_ge_latest` | mid | medium | max_rtt tracks maximum correctly |
| `rtt_update_smoothed_pos` | mid | low | Smoothed RTT remains positive |
| `rtt_update_min_rtt_inv` | mid | medium | min_rtt invariant preserved by update |
| + 13 further structural/helper theorems | low–mid | low–medium | Constructor postconditions, helper lemmas |

**Assessment**: `adjusted_rtt_ge_min_rtt` is the highest-value result in the
entire suite — it directly closes a class of timing attacks described in RFC 9002
§5.3.  The EWMA contraction theorem (`smoothed ≤ max(prev_smoothed, adj_rtt)`)
verifies that the low-pass filter cannot diverge.  **Gap**: no theorem proves
*lower* bounds on `smoothed_rtt` (it could decay toward 0 faster than the true
network RTT); and the `rttvar` EWMA is only bounded above, not below.

---

### `FVSquad/FlowControl.lean` — 22 theorems

| Theorem | Level | Bug-catching potential | Notes |
|---------|-------|----------------------|-------|
| `fc_no_update_needed_after_update` | high | **high** | Update idempotence (no redundant MAX_DATA frames) |
| `fc_max_data_next_gt_when_should_update` | high | **high** | Limit strictly grows when updating |
| `fc_update_idempotent` | high | **high** | Double-update is a no-op |
| `fc_new_inv` | mid | medium | Constructor establishes invariant |
| `fc_update_preserves_inv` | mid | medium | Update preserves window ≤ max_window |
| `fc_autotune_preserves_inv` | mid | medium | Autotune preserves invariant |
| `fc_ensure_lb_ge` | mid | medium | Lower-bound raise achieves stated goal |
| `fc_max_data_next_ge_consumed` | mid | medium | Proposed limit ≥ consumed |
| `fc_consumed_monotone` | mid | medium | Consumed bytes never decrease |
| `fc_autotune_window_when_tuned` | mid | medium | Correct doubling when tuned |
| + 12 further structural/helper theorems | low–mid | low–medium | |

**Assessment**: The flow-control invariants cover the arithmetic safety properties
well.  `fc_no_update_needed_after_update` is important: if it failed, a receiver
might flood the peer with redundant MAX_DATA frames.  `fc_max_data_next_gt_when_should_update`
confirms the non-decreasing guarantee for MAX_DATA (a violated guarantee would be
a QUIC protocol error).  **Gap**: the autotune timing model uses an abstract
boolean `should_tune`, so the interaction between RTT measurement and window
doubling is not verified.  Also, the overflow risk (`consumed + window` wrapping
u64) is not captured.

---

## Gaps and Recommendations

Prioritised by impact:

1. **RecvBuf general-case write** (high): the `insertContiguous` model covers
   only the common in-order path.  The full `write()` function handles
   out-of-order and overlapping data via BTreeMap range-splitting.  Verifying
   invariant preservation for the general case — particularly the no-gap,
   no-duplicate postcondition — is the highest-value remaining proof target
   for the stream layer.

2. **Connection ID sequence management** (high): `quiche/src/cid.rs` is
   security-critical.  `next_scid_seq` strict monotonicity (no CID reuse),
   disjointness of all active CID sequence numbers, and the active-set size
   bound (`≤ active_scid_limit`) are all formally statable and tractable.
   CID reuse would break QUIC anti-linkability guarantees (RFC 9000 §5.1).

3. **CUBIC w_cubic dynamic growth** (medium): the convexity and
   Reno-friendly transition of the CUBIC window curve are not yet proved.
   `wCubicNat_monotone` establishes non-decrease in time; the stronger
   property that W_cubic(t) > W_Reno(t) beyond the transition point would
   confirm correct AIMD–CUBIC mode switching.

4. **RTT lower-bound / decay rate** (medium): add theorems showing
   `smoothed_rtt` cannot fall below some fraction of `min_rtt`.  This
   would catch an under-smoothing bug that could make the congestion
   controller too aggressive.

5. **Flow control u64 overflow guard** (medium): add a bounded model
   (restrict `consumed + window < 2^62`) and prove no overflow occurs
   under the varint limit.  This closes the one known gap between the
   Lean model and the Rust u64 arithmetic.

6. **SendBuf retransmission and reset paths** (medium): the current model
   covers write/emit/ack/updateMaxData but not `retransmit()`, `reset()`,
   `shutdown()`, or `stop()`.  These control the stream termination state
   machine and interact non-trivially with flow control.

7. **Varint wire-format tag bits** (low): add a theorem verifying that the
   2-bit tag in the first byte of an encoded varint matches the length class.
   Current proofs do not cover this aspect.

---

## Concerns

- **Nat vs u64**: all thirteen files model Rust `u64`/`usize` values as Lean
  `Nat` (unbounded). Overflow is the primary unverified risk; see
  CORRESPONDENCE.md for per-file documentation.  The varint file partially
  mitigates this by bounding inputs to `MAX_VAR_INT = 2^62 − 1`.

- **Autotune timing abstraction**: `FlowControl.autotune_window` and the RTT
  minmax filter both rely on `Instant` comparisons that are abstracted away.
  Proofs about the timing-triggered behaviour (window doubling rate, RTT window
  eviction) are therefore not verified.

- **Mutation vs. pure model**: all Lean files replace mutable Rust state with
  pure functional updates.  Aliasing bugs (e.g., two handles to the same
  `FlowControl`) cannot be captured.  In practice quiche's single-threaded
  connection model makes this safe, but it is an acknowledged gap.

---

## Positive Findings

- **`adjusted_rtt_ge_min_rtt`** (RttStats.lean): the proof required non-trivial
  case analysis on the ack-delay condition.  The theorem directly encodes the
  security rationale from RFC 9002 §5.3, and the proof was not trivial —
  demonstrating that the Lean suite is exercising real proof obligations, not
  just stating tautologies.

- **`fc_max_data_next_gt_when_should_update`** (FlowControl.lean): the `omega`
  tactic closed this automatically after unfolding, confirming the arithmetic
  inequality is tight and non-trivial.

- **`insert_preserves_invariant`** (RangeSet.lean): the inductive proof of
  sorted+disjoint+merged under insertion required substantial case splitting and
  was the most complex proof in the suite.  Its success gives high confidence in
  the ACK-range deduplication logic.

- **`decode_pktnum_correct`** (PacketNumDecode.lean, run 39): the first
  end-to-end algorithm correctness theorem in the suite — proves that RFC 9000
  §A.3's packet number decoding function returns the correct result under the
  QUIC proximity invariant, for all three window-shift cases.  During the proof,
  a genuine counterexample to the original (run 38) theorem statement was
  discovered: the non-strict lower-bound allowed an erroneous branch-1 fire at
  `actual_pn = expected_pn − pnHwin`.  The theorem was tightened to use strict
  `<` (as specified in RFC 9000 §A.3 itself), confirming that the FV process
  caught a real precision gap that the original code review missed.

### `FVSquad/NewReno.lean` — 13 theorems (added run 34)

| Theorem | Level | Bug-catching potential | Notes |
|---------|-------|----------------------|-------|
| `cwnd_floor_new_event` | high | **high** | cwnd ≥ mss\*2 after any fresh congestion event — directly captures the RFC 6582 minimum-window floor |
| `single_halving` | high | **high** | In-recovery congestion_event is a no-op; prevents compounding halvings for multiple losses in one epoch |
| `congestion_event_sets_recovery` | mid | medium | `in_recovery` flag is set correctly; guards subsequent events |
| `congestion_event_idempotent` | mid | medium | Two consecutive loss events = one; structural safety |
| `slow_start_growth` | mid | medium | Slow start increases cwnd by exactly mss per ACK (not guarded) |
| `ca_ack_no_growth` | mid | medium | CA counter below threshold — window unchanged |
| `ca_ack_growth` | mid | medium | CA counter at threshold — window grows by exactly mss |
| `recovery_no_growth` | low | medium | In-recovery ACK has no effect on cwnd |
| `app_limited_no_growth` | low | low | App-limited ACK has no effect on cwnd |
| `acked_cwnd_monotone` | mid | **high** | on_packet_acked never decreases cwnd — monotone growth invariant |
| `acked_preserves_floor_inv` | mid | **high** | FloorInv is an inductive invariant under ACKs |
| `congestion_event_cwnd_le_of_floor` | mid | medium | Under FloorInv, congestion_event cannot raise cwnd |
| `congestion_event_establishes_floor` | mid | **high** | Any fresh congestion event establishes FloorInv from scratch |

**Assessment**: The floor invariant (`cwnd ≥ mss * 2`) is the most valuable
property — it prevents the connection from stalling at sub-MSS window sizes and
is directly required by RFC 6582.  `single_halving` and `acked_cwnd_monotone`
together guarantee the two core AIMD safety properties: the window never grows
on losses and never shrinks on ACKs.  **Gaps**: (1) no theorem verifies the
exact AIMD growth rate (one MSS per cwnd bytes ACKed) across multiple ACK
callbacks; (2) HyStart++ (CSS branch) is fully abstracted away; (3) the
`f64 * 0.5` cast is modelled as Nat `/2` — the floor-vs-round question from the
informal spec remains unaddressed.

---

### DatagramQueue (`FVSquad/DatagramQueue.lean`) — 26 theorems

| Theorem | Level | Bug-catching potential | Notes |
|---------|-------|----------------------|-------|
| `push_preserves_cap_inv` | mid | high | Capacity bound enforced by push: `len ≤ maxLen` after every successful push |
| `pop_preserves_cap_inv` | mid | medium | Capacity can only decrease on pop |
| `purge_preserves_cap_inv` | mid | medium | Purge can only decrease len |
| `push_byteSize_inc` | mid | high | Byte-size counter stays accurate after push |
| `pop_byteSize_dec` | mid | high | Byte-size counter stays accurate after pop — key for bandwidth estimation |
| `push_pop_singleton` | mid | medium | Round-trip: push then pop on empty queue recovers element |
| `push_then_pop_front_unchanged` | mid | high | FIFO ordering: pop returns original front, not the just-pushed element |
| `purge_removes_matching` | mid | medium | Purge correctness: no matching element survives |
| `purge_keeps_non_matching` | mid | medium | Purge completeness: all non-matching elements survive |
| `push_fails_iff_full` | low | medium | Error path: push returns None iff at capacity |
| `purge_noop` / `purge_all` | low | low | Purge identity and full-removal edge cases |
| 15 others | low | low | isEmpty/isFull consistency, new postconditions |

**Assessment**: Mid-level utility.  The three most valuable theorems are
`push_byteSize_inc`/`pop_byteSize_dec` (byte-size invariant, important for
send-budget accounting), `push_then_pop_front_unchanged` (FIFO ordering,
important for datagram delivery order), and `push_preserves_cap_inv` (capacity
bound, important for backpressure).  A real implementation bug in the
`queue_bytes_size` counter would be caught by the byte-size theorems.
**Gaps**: (1) zero-length datagram edge case (byteSize=0 yet !isEmpty) not
covered; (2) `peek_front_bytes` not modelled (requires byte-slice model);
(3) `max_len=0` (immediately full) is consistent with the model but not
separately exercised.

---

### Target 9: PacketNumDecode (24 theorems, 0 sorry) ✅

| Theorem | Level | Bug-catching potential | Notes |
|---------|-------|----------------------|-------|
| `decode_mod_win_exact` | mid | **high** | If the arithmetic model were wrong, the central RFC 9000 §17.1 invariant would fail. Proves the decoded number carries the right low-order bits. |
| `test_vector_rfc_example` + 6 others | low | medium | 7 concrete test vectors cross-validate the model against quiche's own test suite. Any discrepancy in the arithmetic model would surface here. |
| `candidate_lt_expected_plus_win` / `expected_lt_candidate_plus_win` | low | medium | Structural bounds on candidate proximity to expected_pn; used in branch-2 upper bound. |
| `decode_branch2_upper` | mid | medium | Downward-adjustment result stays ≤ expected + hwin. Would catch an off-by-one in the branch condition. |
| `decode_branch1_overflow_guard` | mid | **high** | Proves the overflow guard correctly prevents the result exceeding 2^62. A missing or wrong guard could allow illegal QUIC packet numbers in practice. |
| `candidate_shift_win` | low | low | Structural monotonicity lemma. Useful for inductive arguments. |
| `decode_pktnum_correct` | high | **high** | Main correctness theorem: under QUIC invariant, decode returns the right packet number. **FULLY PROVED** (run 39) via 3-way window-quotient case split with `mul_uniq_in_range`. |
| `mul_uniq_in_range` | low | low | Helper: unique-multiple-in-interval lemma. Used internally by `decode_pktnum_correct`. |
| `decode_nonneg` | trivial | none | Trivially true for Nat; no bug-catching value. |

**Findings from run 39**: During the proof of `decode_pktnum_correct` an
**edge case was discovered**: the original theorem statement had `hprox2 :
largest_pn + 1 ≤ actual_pn + pnHwin` (non-strict). A counterexample exists at
`actual_pn = expected_pn − pnHwin` where branch 1 fires and returns
`actual_pn + win` instead of `actual_pn`. This is a genuine divergence between
the arithmetic Lean model and the RFC 9000 §A.3 invariant, which uses a strict
lower bound (`actual_pn > expected_pn − pn_hwin`). The theorem was corrected to
use strict `<` plus bounds `hoverflow : actual_pn < 2^62` and `hwin_le :
pnWin ≤ 2^62` (both always satisfied in real QUIC usage).

**Overall assessment**: `PacketNumDecode` is now fully verified. The
`decode_pkt_num` function is called for every received QUIC packet, and a
decode error would result in dropped or misrouted packets. The proof covers
the complete RFC 9000 §A.3 correctness argument for all three window-shift
cases (upward adjustment, downward adjustment, no adjustment).

---

### Target 10: CUBIC congestion control (`FVSquad/Cubic.lean`) — 26 theorems ✅

| Theorem | Level | Bug-catching potential | Notes |
|---------|-------|----------------------|-------|
| `wCubic_epoch_anchor` | high | **high** | RFC 8312bis §5.1: CUBIC curve passes through the reduction point at epoch start — verifies the fundamental W_max anchor property |
| `ssthresh_lt_cwnd_pos` | high | **high** | On every fresh loss event, ssthresh < cwnd (strict reduction) — the key CUBIC safety property |
| `fastConv_wmax_lt_cwnd` | high | **high** | Fast convergence: w_max is reduced below cwnd when below prior peak |
| `wCubicNat_monotone` | high | medium | W_cubic is non-decreasing in time — confirms the "restore-then-grow" curve shape |
| `wCubicNat_ge_wmax_of_t_ge_k` | mid | medium | W_cubic ≥ w_max when t ≥ K — curve correctly rises above the prior peak |
| `congestionEvent_reduces_cwnd` | mid | **high** | cwnd > 0 → new_cwnd < cwnd; strict reduction on congestion |
| `wCubicNat_at_k_eq_wmax` | mid | medium | W_cubic(K) = w_max — exact epoch-anchor identity (Nat model) |
| `fastConv_monotone` | mid | low | Monotonicity of fast-convergence w_max function |
| 18 others | low | low | Concrete test vectors, structural helpers, parameter bounds |

**Assessment**: The epoch-anchor and strict-reduction theorems are high-value.
`wCubic_epoch_anchor` formally verifies the mathematical property that defines
CUBIC's recovery behaviour: after a loss, the window starts at the correct
fractional reduction point and the CUBIC curve is anchored there.
`ssthresh_lt_cwnd_pos` prevents the pathological case of a loss event that
fails to reduce the congestion window. **Gap**: (1) the Reno-friendly
transition theorem (W_cubic vs W_est comparison) is not proved; (2) the f64
cube root (`libm::cbrt`) is abstracted as a hypothesis — the libm
implementation is not verified; (3) no multi-loss-event monotonicity theorem
verifies that repeated losses converge the window correctly.

---

### Target 11: RangeBuf offset arithmetic (`FVSquad/RangeBuf.lean`) — 19 theorems ✅

| Theorem | Level | Bug-catching potential | Notes |
|---------|-------|----------------------|-------|
| `consume_maxOff` | high | **high** | `consume` preserves `maxOff` — the BTreeMap key in `RecvBuf` is stable across partial reads. A violation would corrupt the BTreeMap ordering |
| `split_adjacent` | high | **high** | `left.maxOff = right.off` — no gap, no overlap between split halves. A violation would create a data hole or duplicate region |
| `split_maxOff` | mid | **high** | `right.maxOff = original.maxOff` — split preserves the right-side boundary |
| `consume_split_maxOff` | mid | medium | Composing consume then split preserves maxOff |
| `split_len_partition` | mid | medium | `left.len + right.len = original.len` — partition is complete, no byte loss |
| `split_left_fin_false` | mid | medium | Left half never carries the FIN bit — only the rightmost split fragment can be terminal |
| `split_right_fin` | mid | medium | Right half inherits the original FIN flag |
| `maxOff_identity` | low | low | `maxOff = curOff + curLen` — definitional consistency |
| 11 others | low | low | Structural helpers, test vectors, monotonicity |

**Assessment**: `consume_maxOff` and `split_adjacent` are the most important
theorems: both prove properties relied upon by the `RecvBuf` reassembler.
`RecvBuf` keys its BTreeMap on `max_off`; a `consume` call that changed
`max_off` would silently corrupt the tree. `split_adjacent` proves the
partition is exact — a gap would silently drop bytes. These theorems are
foundational for the RecvBuf proofs. **Gap**: byte contents are abstracted
away; data integrity through consume and split is not verified.

---

### Target 12: Stream receive buffer (`FVSquad/RecvBuf.lean`) — 32 theorems ✅

| Theorem | Level | Bug-catching potential | Notes |
|---------|-------|----------------------|-------|
| `emitN_preserves_inv` | high | **high** | All 5 buffer invariants preserved by `emitN` (read-cursor advance) — structural safety of the reassembler read path |
| `insertContiguous_inv` | high | **high** | All 5 buffer invariants preserved by in-order sequential write — structural safety of the common write path |
| `insertContiguous_two_highMark` | high | **high** | Two sequential writes advance `highMark` by `c1.len + c2.len` — byte-count accounting correctness |
| `insertContiguous_highMark_grows` | mid | **high** | Non-empty write strictly advances `highMark` — monotone progress |
| `emitN_readOff_nondecreasing` | mid | **high** | Read cursor never moves backward — stream delivery ordering |
| `isFin_readOff_eq_highMark` | mid | medium | When FIN is set and stream is drained, `readOff = highMark` |
| `chunksAbove_mono` | low | low | Ordering helper |
| `chunksAbove_of_ordered` | low | low | Structural helper |
| 24 others | low | low | Invariant sub-properties, accessor identities, test vectors |

**Assessment**: The invariant-preservation theorems are high-value for the
most complex data structure in the stream layer. The RecvBuf reassembler is
the code path for all QUIC stream data delivery; a bug corrupting chunk
ordering or byte accounting would silently produce garbled application data.
`insertContiguous_inv` is the key result — it proves the well-formedness
invariant is an inductive invariant of the common write path. **Gaps**:
(1) `insertContiguous` models only the contiguous (in-order) path; the
general overlapping-write case is not proved; (2) flow-control limit
enforcement (`highMark ≤ max_data`) is not modelled; (3) drain mode and
reset handling are not covered.

---

### Target 13: Stream send buffer (`FVSquad/SendBuf.lean`) — 43 theorems ✅

| Theorem | Level | Bug-catching potential | Notes |
|---------|-------|----------------------|-------|
| `emitN_le_maxData` | high | **high** | **Security property**: `emitOff` can never exceed `maxData` after any emit — the sender cannot exceed the peer's flow-control credit (RFC 9000 §4.1) |
| `emitN_le_off` | high | **high** | The sender cannot emit beyond bytes that have been written — prevents sending uninitialised data |
| `write_preserves_inv` | high | **high** | All 4 invariants preserved by write (I1–I4 inductive under append) |
| `sb_emitN_preserves_inv` | high | **high** | All 4 invariants preserved by emitN — emitting bytes maintains well-formedness |
| `updateMaxData_preserves_inv` | high | **high** | MAX_DATA increase preserves invariants — flow-control update is safe |
| `write_possible_after_updateMaxData` | high | **high** | If peer sends MAX_DATA ≥ off + n, there is capacity for n bytes — the unblocking guarantee |
| `write_after_setFin_isFin_false` | mid | **high** | Writing past FIN invalidates is_fin — prevents data-after-FIN |
| `ackContiguous_preserves_inv` | mid | medium | ACK processing preserves all invariants |
| `setFin_preserves_inv` | mid | medium | Setting FIN preserves invariants |
| `setFin_isFin` | mid | medium | `setFin` correctly sets the FIN flag |
| `write_compose` | mid | medium | Sequential writes compose correctly: `write(n₁).write(n₂) = write(n₁+n₂)` |

**Assessment**: `emitN_le_maxData` is the most security-relevant theorem in
the entire suite — it formally proves the QUIC flow-control invariant for the
send path at the level of individual byte offsets. A violation would allow a
malicious receiver to withhold MAX_DATA updates and force the sender into
negative credit, or (more practically) a sender implementation bug could
exceed the advertised limit and violate the QUIC connection. The four
invariant-preservation theorems collectively prove that the send buffer
maintains its well-formedness under all modelled operations. **Gaps**:
(1) retransmission, reset, shutdown, and stop paths not modelled; (2) the ack
model uses contiguous-prefix only (not the full RangeSet ack); (3) Nat vs u64
overflow is not captured; (4) `blocked_at` and `error` fields not modelled.
